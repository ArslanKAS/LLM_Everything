    "Customer: Actually, yes. I’ve also been experiencing buffering issues while streaming. It happens quite frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: I’m sorry to hear that. Buffering can be quite annoying. Let’s troubleshoot that together. First, could you let me know what device you’re using to stream?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: I usually watch on my smart TV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: Got it. Are you connected via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: I’m connected via Wi-Fi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: Thanks for the information. Buffering issues can sometimes be due to a weak Wi-Fi signal. Have you tried restarting your router and modem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Yes, I’ve done that, but it didn’t help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: I see. Let’s try a few more things. Can you check the speed of your internet connection using a speed test app or website?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Sure, give me a moment. (After a brief pause) The speed test shows 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: Those speeds should be sufficient for streaming. Let’s check the settings on your smart TV. Can you go to the network settings and see if there are any updates available for your TV’s firmware?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Okay, let me check. (After a brief pause) There’s an update available. Should I install it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: Yes, please go ahead and install the update. Sometimes firmware updates can improve streaming performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Alright, it’s installing now. (After a brief pause) The update is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: Great. Now, let’s try streaming again to see if the buffering issue persists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Okay, I’ll check. (After a brief pause) It seems to be working better now. The buffering is much less frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: I’m glad to hear that, Emily. If the issue continues, please let us know, and we can look into it further. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: No, that’s all for now. Thanks a lot for your help, Alex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: You’re welcome, Emily. Thank you for calling StreamNow Support. Have a great day!\n",
